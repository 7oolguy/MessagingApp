# Flutter Firebase Messaging App

This Flutter application is a simple messaging app that allows users to send and receive messages. It utilizes Firebase for backend services such as user authentication and message storage.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can log in using their email and password or create a new account.
- Real-time messaging: Once logged in, users can send and receive messages to/from other registered users.
- Firebase Firestore: Messages are stored in Firestore, ensuring real-time synchronization across devices.
- Flutter UI: The app has a clean and intuitive user interface built using Flutter widgets.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- Firebase account and a project created on Firebase Console
- Firebase configuration added to the Flutter project

# Firebase Setup

 - Go to Firebase Console and create a new project if you haven't already.

 - Set up Firebase Authentication and Firestore for your project.

 - Download the Firebase configuration files (google-services.json for Android and GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS) and add them to your Flutter project.

 - Update the necessary Firebase configurations in the Flutter project to establish a connection with Firebase services.
